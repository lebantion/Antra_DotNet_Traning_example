In-Memory objects: Data/memory stored in collections
Lists, Dictionary, Arrays, can use LINQ because the output of LINQ is IEnumerable

Out-memory sources: sources outside the scope of code:
Json, text, Databases.
LINQ can still be used on these because LINQ is a library of extension methods that target
IEnumerable objects. 

Out-memory sources outputs IQueryable. But IQueryable inherits IEnumerable.

LINQ providers:
LINQ to Objects: Allows to use LINQ on InMemory Sources
LINQ to Entities: Process data stored in External Sources/database
LINQ to XML: Old and not common practice.

ORMs: Object Relational Mapping: Connect Asp.Net Application
to SQL Server without and "Impendnace Mismatch"

Map: conversion of object types

ORMs: need providers to connect your LINQ to SQL Server

IQueryable vs IEnumerable:
Immediate Execution vs Delayed Execution:
